    <p>The ACM/IEEE International Workshop on Quantum Computing is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners interested in quantum, hybrid quantum-classical and quantum inspired computing. Sponsored by ACM and IEEE, the workshop seeks to act as a conduit for the presentation of recent research results in all areas of quantum computing.
    </p>

    <p>Keywords that describe research areas include but are not limited to: quantum algorithms, applications of quantum computing, quantum machine learning, quantum optimization, quantum blockchain, quantum software development, gate-based quantum devices, quantum annealers, digital annealers, quantum network, quantum security, quantum Internet. The keyword “quantum” refers to pure quantum, hybrid quantum-classical and quantum inspired approaches and technologies.
    </p>

    <p>Papers reporting on initial results or work in progress as well as papers discussing mature research projects or case studies of deployed systems are sought out. Submissions describing big ideas that may have significant impact and could lead to interesting discussions at the workshop are encouraged.
    </p>

    <p>Authors should follow the IEEE guidelines when preparing their contributions (maximum paper length: 6 pages with 10-pt font: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
